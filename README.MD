Nginx+PHP+PostgreSQL/MySQL+Adminer by using Docker-compose
=============================
In this repository I tryed to agregate experience of another users for build local WEB-development envirounment by using docker containers.

INSTALLATION
------------
Just unpack the release files in to your directory. You shall see the following files and directories:

    hosts/               Nginx configuration files
    images/php/          Dockerfile and php.ini
    logs/                logs files
    db/data/             mount db configuration directory from container(*)
    db/initdb/           SQL DB initialization files
    www/                 your WEB-Application
    README.MD            this file
    docker-compose.yml   Docker-compose file

You must define envirounment variables `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` (and `DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` if use MySQL) and use the `docker-compose up` command to run containers.
    (*)Notice: the Docker specific variables will only have an effect if you start the container with a data directory that is empty. Any pre-existing database will be left untouched on container startup.
